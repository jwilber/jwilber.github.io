1. add new nodes
2. give those nodes a class, 'response'
3. set those nodes to invisible initially
4. upon transition, show nodes

Once the above is done:
5. select six nodes, give each node a special class
6. for those nodes, we'll move them one-by-one into view for relevant transitions
7. => move all nodes within annotation ring
8. make all nodes visible
9. move nodes off scrren
10. send nodes to histogram



notes:
- give initial test-statistic node a particular color
