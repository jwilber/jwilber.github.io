Instructions for running the code:

First, clone this repo into a dir of your choosing.

```
git clone https://github.com/jwilber/jenkem_soundtrack.git
```

Then, `cd` into that directory and launch a server.
It can be any server; below I use python's `SimpleHTTPServer`, as python comes standard on OSX.

```
cd jenkem_soundtrack

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 # this can be any port
```

Finally, open a web-browser and type `localhost:8000` into the url address bar.

Boom, check out the plot.
