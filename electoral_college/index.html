title:  "The Electoral College Didn't Affect The 2016 Election"

<p>Despite priding itself on being a world symbol of democracy, the United States of America's election process, the [electoral college](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)), has found itself in a position of criticism. </p>


<p>On the one hand, some Americans claim that the electoral college is necessary because it provides a voice to states that otherwise would go ignored. Some Americans claim the opposite, that it's unfair for reason that it yields a disproportionate amount of votes to low-population states. Still others claim that it's arbitrary and unnecessary - after all, [reforming just two state borders and shifting only four counties](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/29/how-the-electoral-college-gerrymanders-the-presidential-vote/?utm_term=.8a9055cd4263) would have resulted in a Hillary Clinton victory. </p>



<p>This blog post investigates the elctoral college. Specifically, it aims to answer the following question: <p>

<p>***Does the electoral college favor one party over another, and if so, did this bias affect the election outcome?***</p>

***

<h2> Randomizing the Election </h2>

<p>To investigate any bias inheret in the electoral college, we'll randomize state creation in the United States of America. Then, we'll use 2016 county-level election data to investigate election outcomes. </p>

![Random State Constructions](https://github.com/jwilber/Randomized_Election/blob/master/images/randomstates2.gif?raw=true "title-1")

<p>In this way we can simulate multiple election outcomes using the same data, gaining a more accurate idea of the role the electoral college plays in American elections.</p>

 ![Random States Color-coded by Victory](https://github.com/jwilber/Randomized_Election/blob/master/images/randomstateswins2.gif?raw=true	 "title-2")

<p>Examples abound of state-level election outcome changing as a function of a state's county composition. For example, the so-called Democratic '*Costal Elite Party*' stereotype usually holds true - states touching the West Coast overwhelmingly vote blue. However, look at Nevada in the above sample of simulations; as state size ventures too far inward, the vast number of Republican counties overtakes the Democrat majority, and the state ends up voting Red. </p>

![Votes by State](https://github.com/jwilber/Randomized_Election/blob/master/images/votes_per_state2.gif?raw=true "title-1")


 <p>When looking at individual vote count per state, this variance is made more clear. Some states, especially those in the so-called '*flyover*' states of the Midwest, have almost no variance in vote outcome. Other states, however, such as California and New York, change often. </p>

 <p>This variance in traditionally blue states occurs because Democrats tend to cluster in cities. These cities usually encompass a majority portion of their state's votes, so when they're not included in a state's composition (e.g., when New York doesn't contain New York City), the state vote composition changes radically. Regardless of the implications this variance may or may not have on the arbitrariness of state boundaries, what's interesting is that the same geographic trends emerge in the majority of simulatiosn: Democrats hold the coasts, Republicans hold the center.</p>

<h2> The Electoral College </h2>

Under the current electoral college format, each state is assigned a minimum of 3 electoral votes, leaving 385 remaining votes to be assigned based on state population.

This process of pre-apportioning votes is often criticised for giving low-population states a disproportionate number of electors per capita; e.g., [an electoral vote represents nearly four times as many people in California as in Wyoming](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-petrocelli/its-time-to-end-the-electoral-college_b_12891764.html). However, concensus on the bias inherent in the electoral college is still a topic of much dispute.

Recall, the electoral vote distribution for the 2016 election:

| Party      | # Electoral Votes |
|------------|-------------------|
| Democrat   | 232               |
| Republican | 306               |


Also recall, Democrats lead in total votes for the 2016 election.

Using the previously described state randomization scheme, we will simulate multiple elections. In this way, we can get better visualize the distribution of possible election outcomes, as well as assess the likelihood of obtaining the results we did.


First, we can view the number of states won by each party across all of the simulations:


![Histogram of states won](https://github.com/jwilber/Randomized_Election/blob/master/images/states_won1.png?raw=true "title-1" width="10" height="10")

Republicans clearly win much more states than Democrats. In fact, Republicans won more states than Democrats across every single simulated election. 

A related, interesting trend occurs across the simulations: as a state's population grows, so too does its propensity to vote Republican:


![Votes by State](https://github.com/jwilber/Randomized_Election/blob/master/images/scatterplots.gif?raw=true "title-1")

This finding isn't very surprising. While it's true that Democratic counties tend to have much higher populations, the 2016 election saw far more Republican counties than Democrat counties. Thus, during randomization, the probability of a state absorbing a red county (and therefore more red population) is far more likely on average than the state absorbing a blue county. Thus, as a state grows larger, it's more likely to vote Republican.

 That said, this difference in state victories isn't necessarily important. In America's winner-take-all election process, what really matters is the number of electoral votes each state brings. 

![Votes by State](https://github.com/jwilber/Randomized_Election/blob/master/images/hist_ev_1.png?raw=true width='100' height='100')


In this case, Republicans *are* accrueing more electoral votes than Democrats across all simulations. What's more, they're doing so more often.

All of this, of course, culminates into more election victories for Republicans:

![Votes by State](https://github.com/jwilber/Randomized_Election/blob/master/images/total_elec1.png?raw=true height='300' width='300')

So clearly Republicans attain much more victories than do Democrats, despite the Democrats having a majority total vote count. Is this result because the electoral college in its current 385 free votes form is biased in favor of Republicans? Or would the outcome be the same regardless of electoral vote pre-apportionment?

### Investigating Bias in the Electoral College

To investigate, we'll repeat the same analyses as above, but for different levels of pre-apportioned votes. In particular, we'll examine what happens as we distribute 3, 2, 1, and 0 pre-apportioned votes, corresponding to ,,, and 538 free votes, respectively.


![Votes by State](https://github.com/jwilber/Randomized_Election/blob/master/images/hist_ev.gif?raw=true width='100' height='100')

[ELECTORAL VOTES HISTOGRAMS]

Interestingly, as we decrease the amount of pre-apportioned votes, the number of electoral votes awarded to Democrats increases. Unexpectedly, however, the magnitude of this change isn't large enough to affect the majoritiy of election outcomes:

![Votes by State](https://github.com/jwilber/Randomized_Election/blob/master/images/total_elec.gif?raw=true width='100' height='100')



So, regardless of the number of electoral votes pre-apportioned, Republicans win more often than Democrats. 

To get a more accurate idea of the number of election wins per party, we can examine the expected value of electoral votes per party, per electoral vote pre-apportionment. We can construct 95% confidence intervals around these estimates and assess our margin of error as well. 


![Votes by State](https://github.com/jwilber/Randomized_Election/blob/master/images/conint_plot.png?raw=true width='100' height='100')


The x-axis in the above plot corresponds to the quantity of pre-apportioned electoral votes (0-3), while the y-axis corresponds to the total count of electoral votes received.

Each dot (color-coded by party affiliation) in the above plot corresponds to that party's mean number of awarded electoral votes. The vertical bars branching off from these points are the 95% confidence intervals for that mean - i.e., the intervals that will capture the mean number of electoral votes in 95% of the cases.

For every iteration, Republicans have a higher expected value of receiving more electoral votes (and therefore, more election victories) than Democrats.

### Conclusions

People criticise the electoral college for saying that it gives unequal representation to smaller states. We removed this unequal representation and showed that no matter what the pre-apportioned amount of electoral college votes, Republicans still would have won the election. This despite there having been more Democratic votes in total. This is true both for simulated and non-simulated states.

Let's address what we set out to answer:

**Does the Electoral College favor Repbulicans?**
In a way, yes. What really appears to be occurring is that the winner-take-all style of the electoral college shows favor to that party with the highest number of counties across the map. In 2016, these counties happened to be the Republicans,though it's likely they will remain Republican in the future.

**Did this bias affect the 2016 Election?**
No. Under any electoral college system, regardless of the number of pre-apportioned votes, Republicans would have won. Under a pure vote-based system, we can't say who would have won. Why? Republicans in blue states (e.g., California) often don't bother voting because they know they're vote will go blue. The same holds true for Democrats in overwhelmingly Republican states. The majority vote for 2016 would be different in a non-winner-take-all system.
