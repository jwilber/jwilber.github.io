                O Winery, Where Art Thou?

        <p class="story">
            Having spent the last six months of my life indoors, I've developed a few new life-enriching 'hobbies':
            staring at my ceiling, pacing alone in circles, and, of course, drinking a lot of wine.
            And while I don't know a ton about wine, I do know that, when the world finally opens up,
            I'd like to spread the wings of my metaphorical wine palette and fly
            beyond the shelves of my local Safeway*. <span class='aside'>*I apologise I made you read that
                sentence.</span>
            <br><br>

            But the world of wine is huge. Like, <i>massive</i> huge. Don't believe me? Try
            <span class='strike'>searching Google</span> asking your Amazon Echo Show 8‚Ñ¢ (üòâ)
            how many wineries there are in the world. Depending on what you define as a winery,
            the number is somewhere between a few hundred thousand and just over one million.
            And that's just the wineries, not the wines themselves.
            <br><br>
            Given the outrageous quantity of wineries, I knew I'd have to narrow down the list.
            But with so many options, where do I go? Should I just sample the most expensive wines?
            Those with the highest point rating? Or should I go for quantity-over-quality and visit
            one with the highest variety?
            <br><br>
            I had no idea, so I decided to try and figure it out.

            wineries* in some of the world's top wine-producing countries: France, Italy, and the United States.
            These three countries cover the majority of cases in our dataset, and limiting the data ensures I
            won't get over-burdened while also providing a decent initial overview of the data we're working with.
            <br><br>
            To my surprise, I found that premium price doesn't always map to premium quality.

                    <p>To begin, let's look at the distribution of prices for wines produced

                <div class="step" data-step="5">
                    <p>This pattern also holds true when we look at
                        another metric of quality - the sentiment value of the wine's review.
                        Though this metric is undoubtedly confounded with price, it's still
                        a bit shocking, and makes our hunt a bit more confusing.

            <span class='aside'>You'll notice I mentioned sentiment. I calculated sentiment of wine reviews on a scale
                from [-1, 1],
                where higher values are positive, lower values are negative.
            </span>Our initial look yielded some useful info: low prices don't always ensure low ratings, and high
            prices
            don't always ensure high ratings. Hmm. That makes things seem a bit less straightfoward.
            <br><br>
            However, when we really think about it, this isn't so unexpected. The nuances of wine prices and ratings
            don't exist in a vaccum,
            they depend on a number of other factors, including the wine variety, the country of origin,
            and the region of production.
            <br><br>
            Sounds like it's time we considered those things!

            Our previous chart highlighted criteria valuable for our search: the <i>price</i> of wine.

            Let's explore this relationship further. We'll view how variety differs in price and rating
            across a few of the most popular countries in our dataset. Below, I plot each of the countries
            wine varieties by their average price and points.

            Intuitively, all countries feature a positive relationship between price and rating. That is,
            on average, higher-priced wines tend to score higher than their lower-priced counterparts. Also,
            keep in mind that we're viewing the average values of the varieties across the entire nation, so
            while some crazy-high priced wines exist in our data, you won't see them here.

            While the previous chart is useful, I really want to make sure that, when I
            eventually get to travel, I get my money's worth.<br><br>
            <span class='aside'>*The <b>price-per-point</b> is the average wine price divided by the average wine
                ratings in a given country. </span>Thus, to get a better idea of the relationship between price and
            rating, we'll look at the <b>price-per-point</b> of wine varieties across countries.
            This provides us with a metric of value that we can use to easily compare varieties:
            high values may represent over-spending on wine, while low values represent bargains.
            <br><br>
            In the chart below, we visualize this metric across different countries for different wine varieties.

            At first glance, one may think the larger a value is, the more superior is the country at
            producing said wine variety. This makes sense on a surface level - if wine costs more per point,
            then it must be higher-quality, right? <br><br>Not exactly.
            <br><br>For one, a higher price-per-point says nothing about the <i>final</i> point-rating of the variety in
            the given country. It's simply yields a relative value. A more fitting way to view the metric
            (as used in our chart) is as an indicator of country specialization, where, in general, scores
            at the tail ends refer to a higher degree of specialization*. <span class='aside'>*By specialization I mean
                either mass
                production of the wine or origin of the
                wine.</span>
            <br><br>
            For example, take <i>Grenache</i>, a famous red wine. The Grenache grape is a
            specialty of (and originated from) Spain, and while it's grown worldwide,
            Spain's conditions make for especially easy and plentiful planting.
            Spain the country with the lowest price-per-point for Grenache.
            <br><br>
            On the other end, take <i>Carignan</i>, another Spanish-origin red wine. Just as with Grenache,
            Carignan is grown worldwide. However, it's grown <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carignan">9 times
                higher in France than in the next major
                Carignan producing country</a>. Sure enough, France has the cheapest price-per-point for Carignan.*
            <span class='aside'>*If you're interested in wine trends, the price differences between Grenache &
                Carignan are worth looking into, particularly because Carignan exists among the declining "workhouse
                varieties",
                Grenache the trendy "improving varieties".</span>

            Will this chart help with my vacation goals? Well, I'm currently a fan of Cinsault,
            so it looks like France may be on the list. But where to go in France? So many regions to chose from

            So far we've been looking at how wines differ from a global perspective.
            But wines differ quite a bit at the regional level as well, with countries
            often having their own dominating regions (think Napa Valley in California, Tuscany in Italy,
            Champagne in France).
            <br><br>
            And while the popular regions often dominate wine-ratings, they're not always the
            best options for variety, or those most enjoyed by reviewers.

                    For wine purposes, Italy is often divided into the North and South.
                    with the warmer growing conditions of the south tending to produce wines that are more riper &

                    I decided to include California and not the entire continental United States for two reasons.
                    First, to keep geographic areas of comparison roughly similar. Second, because U.S. wine primarily
                    comes from California.
                    The Golden State is a promising example of New World wine* <span class='aside-geo'>*Wines produced

                    across its North, South, and Central regions. It houses the premier wine regions of Napa and

                    Spain has a rich history of viticulture, and Spanish wines have been traded worldwide
                    for centuries (including the Mediterranean and North Africa over 3,000 years ago). The country
                    has more acreage under grape cultivation than any other country in the world, and as (briefly)
                    mentioned earlier, is the originator of many popular wine varieties.
