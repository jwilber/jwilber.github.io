    <p id="about">
      I'm currently a Data Scientist at AWS AI, on the Machine Learning
      University team. My main task is to visualize machine learning algorithms,
      but I also help teach courses and work on other general science tasks.
      Prior, I worked as a Data Scientist at a few other Amazon teams and tech
      companies.
      <!-- I'm currently a Data Scientist at Amazon. Before that, I held Data
        Scientist roles in consulting/start-ups. And before that, I was getting
        destroyed in my statistics & computer science courses at UC Berkeley. -->
      <br /><br />
      I enjoy surfing, fitness, and skateboarding. Big fan of yoga as well,
      though I'm pretty trash at it. Oh well, one savasana at a time.
